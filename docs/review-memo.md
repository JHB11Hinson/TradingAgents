### CHG-001 — src layout alignment
- Operator: JHB11Hinson
- Requirement: D1-REQ-GOV-001
- What changed: `tradingagents/` -> `src/tradingagents/`, `cli/` -> `src/cli/`, `tests/` ->
  `test/offline/`, new `test/live/`; pyproject declares the src layout, the build floor and
  `testpaths`; three inherited tests had their repository-root lookup updated (no assertions
  changed)
- Why: the brief (section 5 / D8) requires `src/` and a split offline/live test layout
- Covered by: the full inherited suite (`pytest -q`: 1262 passed, 1 skipped, 1 deselected,
  9.55 s) + `import tradingagents, cli.main` + a wheel containing both in-package resources
- Records: ADR-001, ADR-002, change card in PR #1
- Rollback: `git revert <squash sha>`

### CHG-002 — first blocking gate batch (gate-3, gate-5, gate-6)
- Operator: JHB11Hinson
- Deliverables: D7, D4, D3
- Requirement: D1-REQ-GOV-001
- What changed: replaced the inherited upstream workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `name: CI`,
  7 jobs: the py3.11-3.14 test matrix, clean-install smoke, full-repo ruff) with the first batch of
  our blocking gates (`name: gates`): `gate-3-schema`, `gate-6-ai-use-log` and
  `gate-5-regression`
- Why: the brief asks for machine-enforced blocking gates; batch 1 is the set that can go online
  immediately, now that the src alignment (CHG-001) has merged and the inherited suite is green
- Not in this PR: `docs/code-governance/protection.json`, putting the three names into the branch
  protection `contexts`, and the deliberate-violation experiments - those are the following admin
  nodes; `main` is not protected yet
- Notes: `.github/workflows/**` is human-only (developer manual 4.6 / admin manual 9.11.2); the
  workflow text is authored by JHB11Hinson; submitted on `ci/CHG-002-first-gates`
- Rollback: `git revert <squash sha>` (restores the upstream workflow)
